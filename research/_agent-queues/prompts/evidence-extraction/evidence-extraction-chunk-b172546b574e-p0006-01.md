- Chunk manifest: `raw/chunks/ca07263f40-cv-of-dario-arturo-pulga-p0004-0009-cv-of-dario-arturo-pulgar-pages-4-9-codex/manifest.json`

- Page range: 6-6
- Staging area: `research/_staging`
- Family relevance: `medium`

- Evidence priority: `1306` (family_relevance:medium, qc:spot-check, matched_terms, proof_review_revision)


## Proof Review Revision Context

Previous proof review found staged outputs for this chunk were not yet promotion-ready. Use these notes as revision context, not as authority to alter source text.

| Review | Staged draft | Readiness | Requested follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `research/_staging/reviews/identity-analysis-conflict-stage-chunk-9070adf46a1e-p0006-01-proof-review-postconv-proof-review-20260523123431129.md` | `research/_staging/identity-analysis/identity-analysis-conflict-stage-chunk-9070adf46a1e-p0006-01-identity-and-page-qa.md` | `hold_for_identity_bridge_and_metadata_reconciliation` | Keep the staged identity analysis on hold. Reconcile the converted-file/chunk metadata and stale page-image QA notes with the now-present `page-0006.jpg`, then use an identity-bearing local source or reviewed CV page that explicitly connects `Dario Arturo Pulgar` to `Dario Arturo Pulgar-Smith` before any canonical attachment. Preserve anti-conflation holds for Pulgar-Arriagada and Jose/Juana relationship candidates. |

When revising, do not edit raw sources, converted Markdown, chunks, or page Markdown. Write new or updated staged drafts and/or conversion-review correction notes that preserve the disagreement between derivative transcripts and image-reviewed evidence. If the evidence remains blocked, keep `promotion_recommendation: hold_for_conversion_qa` and make the blocker explicit.


## Person-First Narrative Contract

- Start with known family members and reviewed family relationships, not source chunks as the main object.
- Extract claims only when they can support a family member, family relationship, life event, place in a family story, photograph, or narrative question.
- High-value narrative claims include where a family member stayed, traveled, lived, worked, studied, appeared in a photo, attended a meeting, served as a delegate, spoke, signed, witnessed, or was present for a discussion.
- Context about a hotel, institution, place, co-delegate, meeting, or historical setting is useful only when it directly explains a family member's experience or a specific family record. Keep broad background as a staged context/research note with an explicit linked family entity, or mark it low relevance.
- Do not fan out generic claims about all delegates, all places, or all official proceedings unless the chunk ties them to the family member's narrative.

## Done When

- Relevant source packets, atomic claim drafts, relationship candidates, identity/conflict candidates, and research tasks are written under `research/_staging/`.
- Every draft has source path, converted file, chunk/page reference, literal support, conversion confidence/QA concern, uncertainty, and promotion recommendation.
- Source packets must be Markdown files under `research/_staging/source-packets/` with YAML frontmatter including `type: source_packet`, `status: draft`, source identity fields, chunk/page references, and `promotion_recommendation`.
- Atomic claim drafts that may become canonical must be individual Markdown files under `research/_staging/claims/` with YAML frontmatter including `type: claim`, `claim_type`, `subject`, `predicate`, `object`, `source`, `source_packet`, `chunk`, `chunk_id`, `page_reference`, `confidence`, and `promotion_recommendation`. A grouped claim overview can be written as an extra note, but not instead of promotable atomic claim files.
- Relationship candidates that may become tree links must be individual Markdown files under `research/_staging/relationships/` with YAML frontmatter including `type: relationship_candidate`, `relationship_type`, `person_a`/`person_b` or `child`/`parents`, `source_packet`, `confidence`, and `promotion_recommendation`. If no relationship is stated, write a negative-evidence note with `promotion_recommendation: do_not_promote`.
- If the chunk has low or no family relevance and no explicit family clue, do not fan out broad historical or official-name claims. Write at most a concise source-scope or negative-evidence note, then stop.
- Use `promotion_recommendation: promote_after_review` only for drafts that can be promoted after proof review. Use `hold_for_conversion_qa`, `revise_before_review`, or `do_not_promote` for anything that should not flow to the tree yet.
- No canonical wiki pages are edited by this extraction task.

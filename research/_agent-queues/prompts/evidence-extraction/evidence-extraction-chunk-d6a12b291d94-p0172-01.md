## Proof Review Revision Context

Previous proof review found staged outputs for this chunk were not yet promotion-ready. Use these notes as revision context, not as authority to alter source text.

| Review | Staged draft | Readiness | Requested follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `research/_staging/reviews/proof-review-research-staging-relationships-rel-stage-chunk-d6a12b291d94-p0172-01-515-child-father-postconv-proof-review-20260522062924155.md` | `research/_staging/relationships/REL-STAGE-CHUNK-d6a12b291d94-P0172-01-515-child-father.md` | `hold` | Hold this staged relationship pending a complete source image or continuation-image check for entry 515, focusing on the full child-name field and the complete row context. Do not alter the transcription from derivative context alone; only revise the claim if visible source evidence supports the revision. |
| `research/_staging/reviews/proof-review-research-staging-relationships-rel-stage-chunk-d6a12b291d94-p0172-01-515-child-parents-postconv-proof-review-20260522061147049.md` | `research/_staging/relationships/REL-STAGE-CHUNK-d6a12b291d94-P0172-01-515-child-parents.md` | `hold` | Hold this staged relationship and run conversion QA against a complete source image or continuation image for entry 515, focusing on the child full name and the mother field. Do not promote the combined child-parents relationship until `Carmen Fuentes` is verified from visible source evidence or the candidate is revised to match the portion that can be supported. |

When revising, do not edit raw sources, converted Markdown, chunks, or page Markdown. Write new or updated staged drafts and/or conversion-review correction notes that preserve the disagreement between derivative transcripts and image-reviewed evidence. If the evidence remains blocked, keep `promotion_recommendation: hold_for_conversion_qa` and make the blocker explicit.


## Done When

- Relevant source packets, atomic claim drafts, relationship candidates, identity/conflict candidates, and research tasks are written under `research/_staging/`.
- Every draft has source path, converted file, chunk/page reference, literal support, conversion confidence/QA concern, uncertainty, and promotion recommendation.
- Source packets must be Markdown files under `research/_staging/source-packets/` with YAML frontmatter including `type: source_packet`, `status: draft`, source identity fields, chunk/page references, and `promotion_recommendation`.
- Atomic claim drafts that may become canonical must be individual Markdown files under `research/_staging/claims/` with YAML frontmatter including `type: claim`, `claim_type`, `subject`, `predicate`, `object`, `source`, `source_packet`, `chunk`, `chunk_id`, `page_reference`, `confidence`, and `promotion_recommendation`. A grouped claim overview can be written as an extra note, but not instead of promotable atomic claim files.
- Relationship candidates that may become tree links must be individual Markdown files under `research/_staging/relationships/` with YAML frontmatter including `type: relationship_candidate`, `relationship_type`, `person_a`/`person_b` or `child`/`parents`, `source_packet`, `confidence`, and `promotion_recommendation`. If no relationship is stated, write a negative-evidence note with `promotion_recommendation: do_not_promote`.
- Use `promotion_recommendation: promote_after_review` only for drafts that can be promoted after proof review. Use `hold_for_conversion_qa`, `revise_before_review`, or `do_not_promote` for anything that should not flow to the tree yet.
- No canonical wiki pages are edited by this extraction task.
